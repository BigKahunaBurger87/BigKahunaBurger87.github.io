Welcome to my new blog! This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

## What to Expect

I'll be posting detailed walkthroughs of:
- **HackTheBox Machines** (Easy to Insane)
- **OSCP Preparation Notes**
- **Custom Tool Documentation** (like `bkb-recon` and `ligolo-setup`)

Stay tuned!
